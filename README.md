I was the leading engineer for this project and conducted indepth security and performance validation on McAfee's NS9500 IPS.

The tools involved:
Proxmox
IXIA Breakingpoint
Kali Linux
Windows

In this report, you’ll learn how Miercom tested McAfee’s NSP NGIPS solution for security, performance, and hands-on use. The NSP NGIPS solution was subject to performance test, multiple iterations of attacks from Miercom’s proprietary malware suite, and exploits from Ixia BreakingPoint. The report covers how McAfee stands ahead of competitive IPS products, proving seamless detection and blocking of both known and unknown threats across the network perimeter, data center, and cloud environments.

Top Findings Include:

McAfee NS9500 prevented 99.3% of IXIA BreakingPoint IPS Critical Strike Pack vulnerabilities.
- Prevented 98.7% of malware from Miercom’s Enterprise Critical Protect Malware set consisting of compound threats, zero-day threats, and ransomware (outperforming the industry average by 25%).
- Detected 97.8% of malicious URLs over HTTP with the recommended default configuration (outperforming the competitive industry average by 44%).
- Detected 100% of malicious URLs over HTTP with optimized settings (outperforming the competitive industry average by 47%).
- Successfully prevented 100% of evasive malicious traffic and exploits mounted with mutated traffic.
